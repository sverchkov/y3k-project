```{r go attachment enrichments}
for ( table in go.attachment.enrichments )
  if ( nrow( table ) > 0 ) print( kable( left_join( table, go.term.names, by = c( category = "id" ) ) ) )
```

Go-term enrichments for cliques:
```{r go clique enrichments}
for ( table in go.clique.enrichments )
  if ( nrow( table ) > 0 ) print( kable( left_join( table, go.term.names, by = c( category = "id" ) ) ) )
