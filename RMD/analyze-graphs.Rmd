## Protein placements relative to knockdowns

Are proteins attached directly to their respective knockout nodes?
```{r direct attachments}
# Sanity check
# Check that a gene is under its own KD

for( g in names( resp.nem$mappos ) ){
  gn = sub( "X\\.", "", g )
  if( !any( grep( gn, ferm.nem$mappos[[g]] ) ) ){
    print( paste0("no match in ", gn ) )
  } else
    print( paste0("match in ", gn ) )
}
```

For this next thig we need to get descendent lists first
```{r ancestry list}
d

Are proteins attached downstream of their respective knockout nodes?
```{r downstream attachments}
for( g in names( resp.nem$mappos ) ){
  gn = sub( "X\\.", "", g )
  if( !any( grep( gn, ferm.nem$mappos[[g]] ) ) ){
    print( paste0("no match in ", gn ) )
  } else
    print( paste0("match in ", gn ) )
}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
